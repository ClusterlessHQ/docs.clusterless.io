include::partial$components.adoc[]

Activities perform some type of work on a schedule. An Activity can be a cleanup job, or one that submits remote
asynchronous requests to another system.

Think of an Activity as a "cron job" or "scheduled task".

Unlike a xref:boundary.adoc[Boundary], they don't directly create or use xref:dataset.adoc[Datasets].
