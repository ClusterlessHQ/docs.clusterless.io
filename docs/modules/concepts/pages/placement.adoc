A placement describes where the project should be deployed, the coordinates are:

- xref:provider.adoc[provider] - the name of the target cloud provider (e.g. `aws`)
- account - the account id
- region - the region in which to make the deployment (e.g. `us-east-2`)
- stage - optionally, the prefix namespace to deploy within an account (e.g. `PROD` or `TEST` )
