Boundaries are the integration interfaces that adapt incoming or outgoing data to the Clusterless framework.

There are Ingress and Egress Boundaries.

An ingress boundary accepts data from an external source, creates appropriate metadata for the incoming set of
data objects, and fires events to downstream listeners.

An egress boundary listens to events and adapts the data or metadata for use by an external system.
