= Provider

A provider may be Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, or k8s.

Currently only AWS is supported.

Providers are declared in the xref:placement.adoc section of a xref:project.adoc declaration.

Clusterless only intends to provide and manage capabilities a given provider supports, and to ease operability between
providers.

There is no intent to offer feature parity across providers.
